'''
If I had unlimited power and knowledge of Python, I'd create a virtual reality mmo rpg.
Kinda sorta like the anime Sword Art Online but with more depth and complexity and more fit to my liking.
A living, breathing world where players can explore vast landscapes, interact with NPCs, and embark on epic quests.
A world not bound by the limitations of reality, where the only limit is your imagination.
A world where you can learn new skills, master new abilities, and become the best version of yourself.
